// Woah! -1924812112 doesn't come after 1!!! This line isn't a [comment] either by the way
Well whatever, it doesn't matter [ig]...

Wait... what if I did something like [[this]]? I feel like this is kinda illegal...
By the way this *should* read in "this" twice, but only have one page number for both!
Hopefully your program did that [:)]

[What [are you] doing [to] my [program right now]]? Haha oops sowwy ._.

Whew, back to page 2! I thought this would never happen!!! [:)]

If your output file says 1, -1924812112, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2...
Honestly [] I'm gonna [ ] be kinda sad [:(]
Btw, [] shouldn't actually index anything (except : page numbers)

SERIOUSLY?!? [WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THIS!] The person writing this file isn't very smart...
Also, that last thing should've been converted to lowercase... [:)]

Ok so I can't really think of any more edge cases, so I mean [                                     ]
Actually I just came up with some more edge cases lmao

[What
If
I
Did
This]

[[What
About]
This]

[[This
Is What]
Broke
My
Program]

[Seriously,
It took
me like
three [hours
to fix]
these problems]

I *would* make you do this over the page number, but your program doesn't actually need
to be able to do that, so [ig] that's kind of nice for you [:)]

Ok I'm kinda lazy now... read this[:]
[.][!][@][#][[$]Q#@$#Q%#[@%@]#%%^#(!@(#*$(@&*$]

[] 69 wouldn't be complete without 420 amirite?
[\n][\0] I wrote this at 12:24PM and I have class at 8:00AM [:(]

[I finished this file last night and was planning to send it to the slack today, but
I actually had a lot more work that I expected, so I am sending this file to the slack
pretty late. By the way the reason for this extremely long index is to check if your
program can spill it over onto the next line or not in the output file. I actually
completely forgot about this requirement and I have a feeling some of you guys did too
so here is a bit of a reminder [ig]... Maybe I should stop typing in here lmao]

<1>

Aaaaaaaaaaand we're back at page 1.
Well, if you made it this far, congratulations! You created a really nice and sturdy program.
You know, I am really quite proud of you for coming all this way! ( ‚Üê That would be positive [sentiment]!)

<-1>

Your program shouldn't be reading this lmao - [[[[[[[[[[What are you]]]]] doing]]]]]
Because I sure don't know... NOW FIX YOUR PROGRAM! THIS IS DUE SOON YOU KNOW!!! WTF
