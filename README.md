# üëæDaniel Ryan's Projects

Greetings!‚ú® Looks like you have discovered my repository of projects. Here you will find the various programming projects I have worked on and completed, either for school or as a passion project. Although these projects do not showcase everything I have done, it does show those projects I am most proud of.

## üëèAbout Me

My name is Daniel Ryan and I am currently a second-year student at Southern Methodist University. I am studying Computer Science and Music, with  a minor in Mathematics and hope to bring my contributions into the growing AI and Machine Learning field.

I have experience and knowledge in Java, C++, Python, and ARM. Although all the projects currently present in this repository are in C++, I do hope to add a more variety to showcase in the future.

## üñ•Projects
There are currently five projects in this repository, all of which were made for class assignments. These include:
- **Auto Indexer**: a program for indexing formatted text files
- **Flight Planner**: determines the best paths between two cities based on time or cost
- **Logic Calculator**: a program for calculating logical expressions
- **Search Engine**: a basic search engine for .json files, allowing the user to perform searching, receive relevancy ranked results, select and open articles, and create a persistence index
- **Tweet Sentiment Analyzer**: given a file of formatted tweets and sentiment, can determine the sentiment of new tweets without a given sentiment


## Credits

All projects, data structures, and algorithms have been created by me, Daniel Ryan, with support from various libraries (as credited in the respective projects) and my teachers and teaching assistants and SMU.
